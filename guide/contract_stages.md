# Contract life-cycle: 5 Stages

## 1. Draft

Contracts in the stage **Draft** are visible only for you and your company managers.

**Draft** stage is useful e.g. if you want to create a new contract and try different parameters and terms before sharing it with the contract counterparty for negotiations or signing.

All new native and imported contracts are first created in the **Draft** stage.

You can delete draft contracts anytime.

## 2. Negotiation

After selecting the other party, client or supplier, for the contract it will be automatically moved to **Negotiation** stage.

Contracts at the **Negotiation** stage are visible and editable for the both parties company managers. Contract history log saves all the changes made in the contract.

When the contract is ready for signing, one of the parties can initiate the signing by selecting "APPROVAL AND SIGNING".

## 3. Signing

Contract is in the **Signing** stage while waiting for both parties to approve and sign it.

## 4. Active

Contract is in the **Active** stage from the time the signing is finished, until all contracts liabilities are fulfilled.

Contract liabilities can be e.g. agreed deliveries missing or payments pending.

Contract can be **Active** already before the contract's start date and after it's end date.

## 5. Ended

After contract's all liabilities are fulfilled, it is automatically moved to **Ended** stage.

Contracts in the **Ended** stage are available in the archive search, filters, and reports.
