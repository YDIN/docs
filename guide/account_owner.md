# Client/Supplier Account Owner

Your company can be connected with one or more other companies at the YDIN platform, both with client companies and supplier companies.

Every connection, "account", has a dedicated owner, listed at the Clients/Suppliers page.

Account owner is automatically assigned when the company is connected.

Company owner can change account owners.
