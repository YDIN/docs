# Placeholders

## Background: YDIN as a network 

Contracts, agreements and orders, are legal documents between two parties: The client and the supplier.

The contracts are traditionally signed in two (or more) identical copies, one for both parties, and both parties store and manage their own copies independently.

At YDIN contract management platform, in addition to both parties getting own separate copies ("back-up"), the contracts are also stored and managed as shared documents and data in a way that both parties can easily access the contract document and all the data related to it including:

- Change history (Audit trail)
- Contract fulfillment progress (time reports, milestones, ...)
- Invoicing and payments information
- Up-to-data contact information of all stakeholders

To enable this shared ownership and management of the contract documents and data, YDIN in practice is a network connecting companies doing business together.

## Placeholder model

YDIN implements the network model by using placeholder companies and users.

The placeholders are identical to normal companies and users, expect that they have a placeholder owner ID that marks them as placeholders, but also identifies the creator of the placeholder.

All new companies and users are originally created as placeholders. After creating a placeholder company or user, you can leave it as a placeholder, or invite the company contact person or the colleague/employee to join.

The placeholder users are connected to unique email address, in practice to verified Google and Microsoft accounts.

The placeholder model can be compared to CRM tools like Salesforce or Pipedrive: A sales person lists own client companies and contact persons, and stores contact information and business transaction history about in one database to be used, and uses them as counterparties in the opportunities, leads, and campaigns.

The difference to CRM in YDIN is that the other party, a company or a person, can be invited to join the platform and take over own account and the data assosiated to it.

## Companies

Some companies will not yet, or never, sign up and create their profiles on the YDIN platform for different reasons:

1. The company is a big enterprise, and does not want to use products and services from startup companies
2. Company policies may be limited tools allowed, or a very slow process for approving new tools
3. Company has already own processes and tools in use for contracts management

With company placeholders you can still manage your own whole contract portfolio in one tool: Create your client or supplier company as a placeholder and use it as a counterparty in the contracts.

YDIN's e-Signing is naturally not available for the contracts with a placeholder user as a signing party, you need real persons to sign a contract.

When using placeholders, you use Hard copy signing for the contracts. In practise, export the contract from YDIN as a PDF and proceed with either paper copy signing or any other e-signature service, and then upload the signed contract to YDIN for your contract database.

## Colleagues and employees

Access to the company's contracts and data related to their fulfillment are typically needed by people from different functions, e.g. finance, legal, HR, R&D, and so.

Company account owner can invite colleagues and employees to join the company organization with Manager or Employee user rights. In practice, the colleague or employee is added a placeholder user until he/she signs-up and takes over own account.

## Takeover

When a user signs up for with an email (Google or Microsoft account) that is used in a placeholder, the user automatically "takes over" the placeholder user and the ownership of all its data.

### User profile

User is no longer marked as a placeholder, and the ID of the placeholder creator is removed. Now the user has full ownership of own account and profile information (name, profile photo, phone number, ...).

### Company

If user's company was also a placeholder company, the user becomes the owner of the company, and the company is also changed from placeholder to a regular company

### Contracts

If the placeholder user was already as a counterparty in contracts, e.g. as a Client Business Responsible person, the user gets the same access and ownership rights to those documents and associated data as she would have had if she would been a normal signed-in user all the time.
