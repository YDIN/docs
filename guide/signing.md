# Contract signing

YDIN provides 2 different signing options for contracts:

1. e-Signature
2. Hard copy

## 1. e-Signature

How it works:

1. Select "e-Signature" as the signing option in Contract Builder.
2. When a contract is ready for signing, one of the parties can initiate the signing process by clicking "APPROVAL AND SIGNING" in the Contract Builder to move the contract to the signing stage.
3. In the e-Signature page, the contract is available for final review.
4. The Supplier Business Responsible signs the contract first.
5. The Client Business Responsible gets signing request email notification.
6. After the Client Business Responsible signs the contract, the signing is completed and the contract is moved to Active stage.

e-Signature is possible only with both contract parties as signed up user at YDIN platform.

## 2. Hard copy

Hard copy signing is a useful option when:

1. You need a digital signature with strong authentication, or sign physical copies of the contract.
2. Your counterparty is not signed up at YDIN platform. Hard copy signing works also with Placeholder companies as contract counterparties.

How it works:

1. Download the contract as PDF.
2. Sign the contract "offsite", either with some other e-signature prodivers (DocuSign, HelloSign, etc), or print and sign an actual "hard copy".
3. Upload the signed contract to the YDIN storage.
