# Developer/Designer Seniority levels

**Disclaimer:**

Different titles and "seniority level indicators" are used wildly throughout the industry, as there is no one absolutely right way to define the "seniority" of software professionals. 

The purpose of this categorization is to simplify and provide a shared vocabulary to be used in the YDIN platform.
